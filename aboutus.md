## About Us

<a href="https://www.aahs63.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/aahs_luncheon_group.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-4977 " src="https://www.aahs63.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/aahs_luncheon_group-300x264.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="204" /></a>For those classmates that feel comfortable getting together again, we have resumed our monthly luncheon on the <strong>last Tuesday of each month @ 11:30</strong> at the Alpha Diner on Jackson Road. Unfortunately, due to Covid, Weber's was not able to accommodate us at this time. Turnout has been quite good with about fifteen people.

We hope you will consider joining us for the opportunity to socialize with other members of your Class of '63, their spouses and friends. See below for a map
